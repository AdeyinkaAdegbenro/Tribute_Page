			<h4>Mourinho Quotes</h4>
			<ul>
				<li><em>When I go to the press conference before the game, in my mind the game has already started.</em><br>
				<li><em>“I have top players and, I’m sorry, we have a top manager. Please do not call me arrogant because what I say is true. I’m European champion, I’m not one out of the bottle, I think I’m a special one.” </em>&#45; on taking over at Chelsea in 2004.
				<li><em>“In Portugal we have pretty blue chairs, the Champions League, God and then, right after him, me.” </em>
				<li><em>Look. I'm a coach, I'm not Harry Potter. He is magical, but in reality, there is no magic. Magic is fiction and football is real.</em>&#45; When press said "Jose lost his magic wand" 
				<li><em>“Pressure? Pressure what? Pressure is millions of parents around the world with no money to feed their children.”</em>
			&#45;On the pressure of winning a game after losing twice in a row. Various other public figures paraphrased this quote
				<li><em>“I believe that was the most significant day of his life. ‘The day he said to himself: I’m going to prove 
			to my mother that I can make a living from football.” (After Mourinho quit just one day after he was enrolled in business school by his mother)</em>
			&#45;Neto (Portuguese Journalist) on Mourinho
